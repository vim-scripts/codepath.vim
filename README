codepath.vim is a plugin that provides a simple function to obtain your code
path directory if you have one. The concept is simple: I have a dir located
in $HOME/code where i store all my projects and I want to set current project
directory as root directory for plug-in like NERDTree and CommandT.

It provides a function you can use in the following ways:

nnoremap <silent> <F4> :NERDTreeToggle `=codepath#path()`<cr>
inoremap <silent> <F4> <Esc>:NERDTreeToggle `=codepath#path()` <cr>

or

map   <silent> <C-T> :CommandT <c-r>=codepath#path()<CR><CR>
imap   <silent> <C-T> <ESC>:CommandT <c-r>=codepath#path()<CR><CR>
