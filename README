codepath.vim is a plugin that provides a simple function to obtain your code
path directory if you have one. The concept is simple: I have a dir located
in $HOME/code where i store all my projects and I want to set current project
directory as root directory for plug-in like NERDTree and FuzzyFinderTextMate.
